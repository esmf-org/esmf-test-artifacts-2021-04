WARNING: Open MPI will create a shared memory backing file in a
directory that appears to be mounted on a network filesystem.
Creating the shared memory backup file on a network file system, such
as NFS or Lustre is not recommended -- it may cause excessive network
traffic to your file servers and/or cause shared memory traffic in
Open MPI to be much slower than expected.

You may want to check what the typical temporary directory is on your
node.  Possible sources of the location of this temporary directory
include the $TEMPDIR, $TEMP, and $TMP environment variables.

Note, too, that system administrators can set a list of filesystems
where Open MPI is disallowed from creating temporary files by setting
the MCA parameter "orte_no_session_dir".

  Local host: r2i7n12
  Filename:   /p/work1/tmp/mpotts/openmpi-sessions-10547@r2i7n12_0/28449/1/2/vader_segment.r2i7n12.2

You can set the MCA paramter shmem_mmap_enable_nfs_warning to 0 to
disable this message.
